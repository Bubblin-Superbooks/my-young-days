<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">story of my first evening, so you must try and fancy all about the walk in the park with Jane, and the drive with Grandmamma to the town, and the toy-shop, and what we bought there.</p><p>When we came home it was my tea-time; and after that Jane changed my frock, and did my hair, and took me down to dessert, in the dining-room. Ah, then the shy fit came on, and I bent my head very gravely to take the sweet bits off Uncle Hugh's fork, I remember. But when he had  pushed back his chair, given his arm to grandmamma, and his hand to me, and taken us into the drawing-roomâ€”then, while he made me nestle down on his knee in the soft easy-chair, all my shyness went away at the look of his merry eyes.</p><p>"Now for the goose that Jack killed," he said; and then and there began the funniest story you ever heard. Only I can't tell it in the funny words and with the merry, twinkling glances he gave me.</p></div> </div>
