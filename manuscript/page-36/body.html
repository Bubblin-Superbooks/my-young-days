<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">caps.</p><p>The day that grandmamma's letter came, asking for "one of the dear children to stay with her," dolly was just learning to walk. We were having our firelight play before tea. I had tied up my curls to look like a grown woman's hair, and I had papa's umbrella to keep the rain off dolly in her first walk. Bobbie had papa's hat and stick, and he held Rosalinda's other hand. I was just telling him not to walk so fast, because his long strides would tire our little girl,  when I heard papa's voice calling me.</p><p>In a minute more I was standing between his knees, and mamma was watching my face as I tried to take in the idea of this first visit.</p><p>"Jane shall go with you, my darlingâ€”you will not be all alone," said mamma; "indeed, you shall not go at all if you had rather not, but grandmamma wants to have you."</p></div> </div>
