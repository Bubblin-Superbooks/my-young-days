Susette covered her  face with her hands, and most of us turned away too frightened to look. I remember hiding my face in Jane's gown, and feeling her stroking my hair; and I never looked up till there was a cry that it was all right, and Harry and Murray were both safe on the ground again.</p><p>How glad we all were, and how we all talked at once, and said how we had felt, and how Murray cried though he wasn't hurt, only frightenedâ€”all this I mustn't stop to tell you. By and by it came to be one of those things that are always nice to talk about with  shudders, and sighs, and laughter. Many and many a tea-time the same wonder and thankfulness were repeated, always beginning with, "Don't you remember that dreadful day?" and so on.</p></div> </div>
